# $BOBANAD — React + Vite + Tailwind demo

This repository is a starter for a cartoon-kungfu themed site for the token `$BOBANAD`.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

npm install
```

2. Run development server:

Notes

- Replace Dexscreener iframe `src` attributes in `src/components/Hero.jsx` and `src/components/ChartTokenomics.jsx` with your token-specific Dexscreener URL.
